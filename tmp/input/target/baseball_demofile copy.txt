Dusty Baker, in 1977, was sitting on 29 home runs on the last day of the season.

No MLB team had ever featured four players with 30 or more home runs in a season -- and three of Baker's fellow Los Angeles Dodgers sluggers had already hit their 30th long balls. In the sixth inning, Baker launched a fence-clearing shot off the Houston Astros' J.R. Richard. As Baker crossed home plate and headed toward the dugout, teammate Glenn Burke had his hand up in the air while waiting on deck. And what did Baker do? He slapped it.

It was the birth of the high-five.

In the decades since, the high-five has been found in every corner of the sports world -- from 6-year-olds playing youth sports to the World Cup final. It is both intimate and inherent, and it is deeply entrenched in the DNA of every sport.

Now what?

We might be looking at the end of the high-five due to the coronavirus pandemic. The virus is mostly spread through respiratory droplets, either by breathing them into the lungs or by touching a surface that has droplets on it and then touching the face.

"When we talk about maximum transmission [of the coronavirus], the hands are the place where I focus on the most. When we talk about the high-five and also the handshake, this is almost the perfect pathogen to spread it," Dr. Neel Gandhi, a professor of infectious diseases, epidemiology and global health at Emory University, told ESPN.

When asked if the coronavirus will bring about the end of the high-five and handshake, Gandhi said probably.

"Of all of the things we would say we would advise against, the high-five and the handshake are two in the current era, in the current pandemic, [that] we should not continue to use," he said.
